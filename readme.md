This project teaches you how to develop a simple automatic message through WhatsApp.

This automation works simply, using Python, I imported the pyscreeze, pyautogui, pyperclip and time libraries.
In this project, your WhatsApp must be open in your preferred browser and have the WhatsApp icon as a favorite in your tab bar, the one that you leave as a shortcut at the top of the browser page, I will leave the image that you need to have in the project .
When this code is executed, it will go from the alt tab to your browser and carry out the projects, also notice the comment where you will add your message and to the contact/group you will send.
